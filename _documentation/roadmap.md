# roadmap

Our intention is to release our CLI publicly in 30 days right here.

The CLI allows developers to instantly set up a registry and rancher management with full reverse-proxy SSL automation.

With this as a tool for managing stacks, you can deploy any number of the stacks cloned from our registry instantly based on your needs.

We'll push releases to the master, which can be pulled at anytime. :)
