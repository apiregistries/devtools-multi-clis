# About our team

   Recently, a small group of tech-industry veterans formed a plan to re-align their interests and create something totally new.  A fresh idea so malleable and a culture so filled with excitement!   Since this super-team first rallied nearly 15 years ago the tools have certainly changed, but the dream is simple and their passion is evergreen.
 
   DevStacker is a path forged through years of research and product development, and this hive mind is fueled by their love for the web and excitement of the tough terrain ahead.  We solve some of the toughest tech problems, in a notoriously difficult development world called "Full Stack".

   We are incredibly persistent and can deliver the goods.   We have invented a world for ourselves using platform agnostic cloud development, horizontally scalable architecture, and bleeding-edge software to foster relationships with man and machine.

Our mission is to advance our craft through delivering solutions to our top and bottom line.
 
   Though there is a vast competitive landscape ahead, and many tough problems still left yet to solve, intrinsically we have no fear in this promised land.   We simply walk the path.

upward, friends....
